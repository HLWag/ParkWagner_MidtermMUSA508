Zillowâ€™s housing market predictions, known as Zestimates, are valued for their nationwide coverage and general accuracy. For example, the nationwide median error for off-market homes is 7.5% and for on-market homes is 1.9%.

This analysis aims to build an accurate and generalizable hedonic model that predicts home prices for Miami by deconstructing overall home price into the value of constituent parts.
